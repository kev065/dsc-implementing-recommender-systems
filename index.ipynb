The algorithm is named after Simon Funk, who was part of the team who placed 3rd in the Netflix challenge with this innovative way of performing matrix decomposition. Read more about Funk's SVD implementation at [his original blog post](https://sifter.org/~simon/journal/20061211.html). There is no simple way to include for this fact with SciPy's implementation of `svd()`, but luckily the `surprise` library has Funk's version of SVD implemented to make our lives easier!\n",

Let's make use of the grid search here to account for some different configurations of parameters within the SVD pipeline. This might take some time! You'll notice that the `n_jobs` is parameter set to -1, which ensures that all of the cores on your computer will be used to process fitting and evaluating all of these models. To help keep track of what is occurring here, take note of the different values. This code ended up taking over 16 minutes to complete even with parallelization in effect, so the optimal parameters are given to you for the SVD model below. Use them to train a model and let's see how well it performs. If you want the full grid search experience, feel free to uncomment the code and give it a go!\n",
